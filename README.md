# Palette Frontend 2020

## Introduction

Palette is a design hackathon that is conducted by IEEE-VIT every year. This year it was a 36 hour long online design hack based entirely on the concepts of UI & UX. 

The challenge was that everyone would be given three chances to generate a random problem statement. For example

<img alt="palette-example1" src="https://github.com/ZiyanK/palette-website/blob/master/src/assets/palette-example1.png"/>
